## How to Contribute

### Before You Start

- **Check open pull requests** - Your contribution might already be under review
- **Search closed issues** - Your question or suggestion might have been discussed before

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. If not, create a new issue with:
    - A clear, descriptive title
    - A detailed description of the problem or suggestion
    - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
    - Expected vs actual behavior (for bugs)
    - Any relevant error messages or screenshots
